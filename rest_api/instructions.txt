Note - Entire code is based on python3 syntax and all terminal commands cater to MacOS users.

- Open terminal and cd into rest_api
- Create a virtual environment of python in the folder by running command -> virtualenv venv
- Activate the virtual environment using the following command -> source venv/bin/acticate
- Install all dependencies from requirements.txt using the command -> pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run flask server by running the command -> python3 app/runapp.py
- Copy the url http://localhost:5000/ and paste in a browser to use the rest api
