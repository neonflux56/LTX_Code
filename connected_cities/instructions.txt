Note - Entire code is based on python3 syntax and all terminal commands cater to MacOS users.

Run Solution:
- Open command line and cd into connected_cities dir
- Sample data file with all paired cities is stored in solution folder
- Use MY_FILE_PATH in config.py to change the path to the data file or change filename 
- Run the command -> python3 solution/run.py
- Enter source city and destination city when prompted
- Result shows if the two cities are connected
- A logging file handler is used to log all executions to the file output.log

Example output:
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
Enter the source city: Chicago
Enter the destination city: Boston
------------------------------------
There is a connection between Chicago and Boston!
------------------------------------

Run Unit Test:
- Open command line and cd into connected_cities dir
- Run the command -> python3 -m unittest -v  test.py
- This runs the test.py file which uses unittest module for testing 3 main components of the code
